# Online Smart Employee Manager (OSEM)

## Project Outline:

Online Smart Employee Manager (OSEM) is an online website that managers of an organisation can
use to invite new employees to, where they can manage any credentials and teams, along with viewing
multiple statistics and team chat spaces. Employees will have separate logins that will allow them to
manage their own tasks and teams. The system will be relying on a backend database, which will store
login details as well as any credentials, teams and employee data that may have relationships.
