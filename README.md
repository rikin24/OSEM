# Online Smart Employee Manager (OSEM)

## Project Outline:

Online Smart Employee Manager (OSEM) is an online website that managers of an organisation can use to invite new employees to, where they can manage employeesâ€™ skills and teams, along with planning and organising various events and deadlines. Employees have separate logins that allow them to manage their own tasks and keep a track of events, team updates and their verified skills. The system relies on a backend database, which stores login details as well as any skills, teams and employee/manager data that may have relationships.
